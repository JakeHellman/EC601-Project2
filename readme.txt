phase1a.py
This is a python program which uses the Twitter API in a basic way. It requests tweets with a specific hashtag (in this case, "#Celtics"). Note that if this program is re-run, the date may need to be adjusted. The matching tweets are printed to the terminal and also written to a csv file.

phase1b.py
This is a python program which interacts with the Google Natural Language Processing API in a basic way. It sends two sentences to Google's NLP and prints out the sentiment of each of the sentences individually, as well as the average for the two sentences.
